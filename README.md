# ðŸ’« About Me:
I developed a full-stack online booking platform for tours using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). The platform allows users to browse various tour packages, book tours, and manage their bookings seamlessly. On the backend, I utilized **Node.js** and **Express.js** to create RESTful APIs for handling user authentication, tour bookings, and payment processing. The data is stored in **MongoDB**, which provides a flexible, scalable database solution for storing user information, booking details, and tour data. The frontend is built with **React**, offering an intuitive, dynamic user experience where users can view available tours, filter options, and easily complete their bookings. The platform also includes an **admin panel** where tour operators can manage tour listings, view bookings, and update tour availability. The application integrates a secure payment gateway for processing transactions, ensuring a smooth and reliable booking experience for users.
